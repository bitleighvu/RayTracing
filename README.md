# Ray Tracing
CS3451 Ray Tracing in Processing

### Project Description ### 
Goals:
1. Initialize the scene
2. Cast eye rays for each pixel
3. Detect ray & ellipsoid and ray & disks collisions.
4. Expand your shading function to include ambient and specular lighting.
5. Cast shadow rays to determine when a light should contribute to the color.
6 Implement reflection by recursively casting new rays into the scene from inside your shading function.

Program obeys the following keystroke commands:
* 0-9: Runs test cases
* -: Runs test case

### Run Instructions ###
